If you wish to convey anything to the TA, please put it here.

1. I changed the folder ���one��� to ���two��� to reduce some package error complained by Eclipse.
2. I added some ���throws IOException��� on several main functions.
3. I added a new class called ���FrequencyComparator��� for sorting both strings and frequencies of the object Frequency.
4. For method printFrequencies(), there is a bug that it cannot tell whether the input is for the Palindrome question, so the output format should be a minor problem.
